<p>This is a webpage for the brand new <a href="https://shop.steprevolution.com/collections/products/products/stepmaniax-machine">StepManiaX cabinet</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The machine will be available for all members of the MIT community to use. There is a desktop computer running <a href="https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania">StepMania 5.1</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/dguzek/Simply-Love-SM5/">Simply Love</a> theme behind the cabinet.</p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 0.87em;"><b><span style="color:#c0392b;">Note:</span></b> The PC doesn't recognize the numpads as different devices, so for the time being I have mapped 1379 to P1's controls and 2468 to P2's controls. I recommend using the numpad only for the start button. Check <a href="updates.html">here</a> for updates.</p>

<br/>
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"><b>If you notice any issues with the machine (pads unresponsive, PC turned off, arrow panels cracked, unable to exit a menu, etc.), <a href="mailto:robinp@mit.edu">please contact me via email immediately</a>.</b></span>


<h2>Where is it located?</h2>


<p>The cabinet is located in <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/dining/retail-dining/rebeccas-cafe-walker-memorial"><b>Pritchett Cafe</b></a> next to the <b><a href="https://lbgtq.mit.edu/">Rainbow Lounge</a></b> on the second floor of <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=50"><b>Walker Memorial (Building 50).</b></a> You can get there via the basement or from the side of the building facing East Campus. Pritchett Cafe is open from <b>3pm to 11pm</b> from <b>Monday to Friday</b> over the regular semester. <span style="color:#c0392b;"><b>You will need an MIT student ID card to access the machine outside of cafe hours.</b></span></p>

<h2>ITG events</h2>

I will be hosting Saturday night ITG sessions at the cabinet each week. These sessions are mainly for MIT affiliates, but anyone is free to stop by. If you would like to be reminded of when an event is happening, please subscribe to the <a href="https://lists.csail.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/stepmania">StepMania CSAIL mailing list</a>.

<h2>Special thanks</h2>

<p>We would like to thank the <a href="https://shass.mit.edu/resources/internal/deflorez">De Florez Fund for Humor</a> for funding this project with a total of $7,000 in funds &ndash; this cabinet wouldn't be here if it weren't for their generous donation.</p>

<p>We would also like to thank <a href="http://www.kyleaward.com/">Kyle Ward</a>, CEO of <a href="https://stepmaniax.com/">StepManiaX</a>, for manufacturing the high-quality cabinet and pads and personally assisting us in obtaining a machine. </p>

<p>Finally, thanks to everyone who helped make this project happen, from helping assemble the cabinet to giving moral support.</p>
