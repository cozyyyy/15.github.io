<p>This is a webpage for the brand new <a href="https://shop.steprevolution.com/collections/products/products/stepmaniax-machine">StepManiaX cabinet</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The machine is available for all members of the MIT community to use. We are currently in the process of obtaining a dedicated laptop to run StepMania behind the cabinet with custom songs.</p>

<h2>Where is it located?</h2>

<p>The cabinet is located in <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/dining/retail-dining/rebeccas-cafe-walker-memorial"><b>Pritchett Cafe</b></a> next to the <b><a href="https://lbgtq.mit.edu/">Rainbow Lounge</a></b> on the second floor of <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=50"><b>Walker Memorial (50).</b></a> You can get there via the basement or from the side of the building facing East Campus.</p>

<p>Pritchett Cafe is open from <b>3pm to 9pm</b> on <b>Mondays to Wednesdays</b> over <a href="https://web.mit.edu/iap/">IAP</a>. You will need an MIT ID card to access the machine outside of cafe hours.</p>

<h2>ITG Events</h2>

I will be hosting ITG events at the cabinet regularly. If you would like to be reminded of when an event is happening, please subscribe to the <a href="https://lists.csail.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/stepmania">StepMania CSAIL mailing list</a>.
